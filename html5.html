                <p>
                    we are going to see the difference between html and html 5 in this page.
                    first we used html to make webpages, after that we got a browser and advanced 
                    technologies so we have to update the html aswell for the usage. so we built new
                    things to use in html 5. we are going to see the difference between them in a table 
                    here and also we are going to see about meta characters in head and their uses and interview questions.

                    <th>html</th>
                    <th>html 5</th>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>we use docutype to tell the browser what type of document we are using, and browser use doctype to render the html. <br>
                            it is very long here.
                            we have to enter like this,<br>
                            !doctype HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN""http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            In html 5 we simplify the doctype, so its easy to remember and it no longer references a dtd.
                           <br> it changed to this method<br>
                            !doctype html

                        <td>
                            it has very less input types to use in a form, so its hard for the user.
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            In html 5 we add lot of new input types for the user experience.
                            for ex:<br>
                            email, range, tel, url, number,date , datetime, datetime-local, colour, search

                    not displayed to users, but used by browsers, search engines, and social platforms.
                    It is always placed inside the head section.
